Project HomeSmartHome

Started as a school project, this is going to be developed further.

The idea is to create a system to control your home via a Raspberry Pi and a smartphone. The goal is to offer a cheap and easy to setup solution for everyone.

For now it's only possible to control a modified, fully automatic coffee machine directly hooked to the Raspi.
